# Key Kalimba

**Key Kalimba** is an interactive, web-based 17-key Kalimba trainer and tuner. Play along with falling notes, load custom MIDI songs, and tune your physical instrument with built-in pitch detection—directly in your browser on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Falling Notes Visualizer**: Learn songs intuitively with falling note tiles synchronized in real time with high-fidelity acoustic Kalimba audio.
- **Physical Instrument Calibration**: Adjust the scale/zoom so the digital tines perfectly match the physical width of your real Kalimba when placed over your screen.
- **Custom MIDI Support**: Import any `.mid` or `.midi` file and practice at your own pace with adjustable tempo and timeline scrubbing.
- **Integrated Kalimba Tuner**: Tune each tine using your device microphone. Real-time pitch tracking guides you with clear visual feedback (in tune, sharp, flat) and tracks your tuning progress across all 17 keys.
- **Customizable Notation**: Toggle numbered musical notation (`1 2 3`) and octave indicators on the tines, and switch between major and alternate tunings (C Major, G Major, F Major, Bb Major, etc.).
- **Mobile & PWA Ready**: Optimized for touchscreens and landscape orientation, with offline support for practicing anywhere.
